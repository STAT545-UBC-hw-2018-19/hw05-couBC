As always, need to load gapminder and tidyverse

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(forcats))
library(scales)
library(plotly)
```

*Part 1 of the assignment - Factor management*

Elaboration for the gapminder data set:
First, filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. In order to get a comparison of the structure before tinkering around with gapminder, I will look at the structure of gapminder and the factorness of gapminder$continent

```{r}
str(gapminder)
str(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
class(gapminder$continent)
```


```{r}
forcats::fct_count(gapminder$continent)
```
The other way to do this is using dplyr:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  count(continent)
```


```{r}
no_oceania <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent!="Oceania")

str(no_oceania)

#after I filtered out Oceania, there are only 1680 rows compared to 1704 with Oceania not filtered, however the structure function tells me that continent is a factor with 5 levels as before.
```


```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)
#I still have Oceania as a level using the method above
```

Because I still have Oceania as a level using the filter method, I will now try using the forcats_drop way. 



```{r}
no_oceania$continent %>% 
  fct_drop() %>% 
  levels()

no_oceania
#Oceania is now removed as a factor level. After dropping Oceania, I have 1,680 rows whereas before I had 1704, so that's a sanity check to see that it worked.
```

Now I will re-order the continents based on aggregate population of each continent from smallest to largest

```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder$continent, gapminder$pop, max) %>% 
  levels() %>% 
  head()
```

Backwards re-order, from largest population to smallest:

```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder$continent, gapminder$pop, max, .desc = TRUE) %>% 
  levels() %>% 
  head() 
```


Now to create a plot to verify that indeed Asia has largest population and Europe has smallest. 

```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=1}
my_gap <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_infreq(continent, pop)) 

ggplot(my_gap, aes(continent, pop)) +
    geom_point()

#I don't know why it is not ordering it from most populous continent to least populous
  
```
 
#Part 2 File I/O

```{r}
Amer_gap <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007, continent == "Americas")

str(Amer_gap)

```

```{r}

```



#Part 3 Visualization design

*Before*
So starting off with plotting lifeExp and gdpPercap gives me this figure. Overall, from this figure, I can see that life expectancy goes up with gdp but i don't know anything much else about those data points e.g., which continent, population density etc., 
```{r}

ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) + scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_point() 

```

*After*

labels=dollar_format()

```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = dollar_format()) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=1:10 * 10, labels = comma_format()) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, alpha = .2)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "GDP",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       title = "Life Expectancy and GDP by Continent") +
theme_classic() +
theme(axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14))

p

#I think this second graph is a more interesting and informative graph. It hasclear labels. It includes a Loess line with standard error. We can where the countries from different continents land in terms of life expectancy and GPD. However, I don't know how to get rid of the alpha on the legend. 
```


##Now I will convert the above ggplot to plotly by first loading plotly

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
```


```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=1}
# p %>% 
#   ggplotly()

#Using plotly has the benefits of being an interactive graph that can tell you information about each data point that you hover over. You can also compare multiple data points using "compare data over hover". You can also zoom in and out to further inspect the data points
```



#Part 4 - Using ggsave 


```{r}
ggsave("hw05_plot.png", p, scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, dpi = 600, limitsize = TRUE)
```

Now I don't know how to reopen it and embed it into the report....
Then use ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png) to load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:

    Arguments of ggsave(), such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
